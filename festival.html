		<h1 id="schedule-coming">2019 schedule coming soon!</h1>
	    <h1>the 2018 schedule</h1>
            <p>The 2018 Ivy Film Festival took place at Brown University from April 9-15, 2018. All events
            were free and open to the public. </p>

            <h1><a id="fb-day-event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/202107907231926/">Monday, April 9th</a></h1>

            <h3>Screening: #TAKEMEANYWHERE<br>
            Keynote:  LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner<br>
            6-8pm @ Salomon DECI Auditorium</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In mid-2016, Shia LaBeouf (<a href="https://twitter.com/thecampaignbook">@thecampaignbook</a>), 
            Nastja Säde Rönkkö (<a href="https://twitter.com/nastjaronkko">@nastjaronkko</a>),
            and Luke Turner (<a href="https://twitter.com/Luke_Turner">@luke_turner</a>)
            tweeted out their GPS coordinates, asking the public to pick them
            up and take them anywhere they chose. This launched #TAKEMEANYWHERE,
            an art project that would yield a film of staggering scale and beauty,
            as the artists took a cross-country trip that illuminated the beauty
            of humanity. It’s a film about the artists, about the participants,
            about the country. It’s a film about all of us.</p>

            <p>For the Keynote event, we screened #TAKEMEANYWHERE. Afterwards,
            Mr. LaBeouf and Mr. Turner conducted a Q&A (with Ms. Ronkko Skyping in). </p>

            <p>IFF is proud to announce its first-ever partnership with the Aegean
            Film Festival, based in Patmos, Greece. IFF featured the Aegean
            Film Festival’s Short Program, made up of
            award-winning short films from across the world. A program of IFF’s
            official selection was screened at the Aegean Film Festival
            this summer. This partnership aims to build lasting relationships
            between IFF and the international film community and provide new
            opportunities for students to engage with the globally-practiced
            craft of short filmmaking.</p>

             Q&A with Director Betsy West.</p>

            <p>Based on the beloved Ian McEwan novel, “On Chesil Beach” is a
            beautiful and important new film due in theaters on May 18th. In

            virgins, spend their honeymoon preoccupied and terrified by the

            <p>As one of the first student-run film festivals in the world to
            pioneer an initiative geared towards virtual reality, IFF’s New
            Media Initiative aims to foster the next generation’s dialogue
            around VR storytelling. This year, IFF showcased student-made
            VR and AR projects on Google Daydream and HTC Vive, as well as
            providing a hands-on environment for attendees to explore cutting-edge
            new media technologies.</p>

            <p>IFF’s 2018 Official Selection of undergraduate and graduate student

            year’s Official Selection of screenplays honored the top three
            scripts from four categories: undergraduate short, graduate short,
            features and TV pilots. The students on our programming and
            screenplay departments created these selections from over 500

            <p>“This year’s “Moonlight.” That’s what IndieWire had to say about
            this deeply moving Sundance standout. Starring Raul Castillo and
            Josiah Gabriel, and directed by documentary veteran Jeremiah Zagar,
            this film follows three brothers through their troubled and
            formative childhood in upstate New York. Based on the novel by
            Justin Torres.</p>

            and graduate students from all over the world. This year’s Final
            Selection honored the top 3 scripts from 4 categories: undergraduate
            short, graduate short, features and TV pilots. This year’s
            screenplays stood out for their high quality writing and storytelling,
            making this one of the most competitive submission pools to date.</p>

            <h3> The Future (of film) is Female Speaker Series pt. 1: Victoria Tennant<br>
            1-2pm @ Granoff Studio 2</h3>
            <br>
            <p>From the impact of the #MeToo movement, to the success of films
            like Lady Bird, Wonder Woman, and Mudbound, it is impossible to deny
            that the future of film is female.
            We featured two incredible actors to talk and answer questions about
            their lives in front of the camera in this two-day event.</p>
            <p>Victoria Tennant trained at the Elmhurst Ballet School and at the
            Central School for Speech and Drama in London. In her first film,
            she starred in the title role of The Ragman’s Daughter. Subsequent
            films include All of Me with Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin, LA Story
            with Steve Martin, Stranger’s Kiss, The Plague, The Handmaid’s Tale

            with Michael Caine, and Louder Than Words with David Duchovny and
            Timothy Hutton. Ms. Tennant has also worked extensively in television
            including the miniseries and television movies The Winds of War and
            War and Remembrance, Chiefs, Dempsey, Under Siege, and The Man From
            Snowy River. She also wrote and co-produced the film Edie and Pen

            5-6pm @ Granoff Studio 2</h3>
            <br>
            <p>From the impact of the #MeToo movement, to the success of films
            like Lady Bird, Wonder Woman, and Mudbound, it is impossible to deny
            that the future of film is female.

            <p>Isabelle Fuhrman is best known for her roles in films like "The Hunger Games" and "Orphan", and the critically acclaimed Showtime TV series, "Masters of Sex". Considered one of her generation’s most promising young talents, the versatile performer also writes and directs her own material. Upcoming, Isabelle will star in Lionsgate’s "Down A Dark Hall" opposite AnnaSophia Robb and Uma Thurman, and the much-buzzed about indie "Shoplifters of the World" opposite Sasha Lane. Isabelle began her career at the age of seven and received her training at the highly selective Shakespeare and Contemporary Drama summer programs at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.</p>


            <h3>Advanced Screening of “Eighth Grade”<br>
            7-8:30pm @ Granoff Martinos Auditorium</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Bo Burnham’s directorial debut premiered at the 2018 Sundance
            Film Festival to audience and critical acclaim, featuring breakout
            star Elsie Fisher. The story follows thirteen-year-old Kayla as she
            endures the tidal wave of contemporary suburban adolescence as she
            makes her way through the last week of middle school--the end of her
            thus far disastrous eighth grade year before she begins high school.
            Eighth Grade was the final screening of IFF 2018.</p>
