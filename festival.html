            <h3>Screening: #TAKEMEANYWHERE<br>
            Keynote: Shia LaBeouf</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In May 2016, Shia LaBeouf
            (<a href="https://twitter.com/thecampaignbook">@thecampaignbook</a>)
            tweeted out his GPS coordinates, asking his fans to pick him up and
            take him, along with partners Luke Turner
            (<a href="https://twitter.com/Luke_Turner">@luke_turner</a>) and
            Nastja Ronkko (<a href="https://twitter.com/nastjaronkko">@nastjaronkko</a>),
            anywhere they want. This launched #TAKEMEANYWHERE, an art project
            that would yield a film of staggering scale and beauty, as the
            artists took a cross-country trip that illuminated the beauty of
            humanity. It’s a film about the artists, about their fans, about
            the country. It’s a film about all of us.</p>
            <p> For a Keynote event, we will screen #TAKEMEANYWHERE.
            Afterwards, Mr. LaBeouf and Mr. Turner will conduct a Q&A
            (with Ms. Ronkko Skyping in). You don’t want to miss it.</p>



            <h3>Screening: On Chesil Beach<br>
            Keynote: Dominic Cooke</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Based on the beloved Ian McEwan novel, “On Chesil Beach” is a
            beautiful and important new film due in theaters on May 18th. In
            1962, newlyweds Florence (Academy Award nominee Saoirse Ronan)
            and Edward (Billy Howle), both in their early 20s and also both
            virgins, spend their honeymoon preoccupied and terrified by the
            upcoming consummation of their marriage. Afterwards, join us for a
            Q&A with director Dominic Cooke (The Hollow Crown).</p>

            <h3> “More Than Scream Queens”: Women in Horror Panel<br>
            ft. Abigail Breslin, Isabelle Fuhrman, Victoria Tennant</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Isabelle Fuhrman (The Orphan), Abigail Breslin (Scream Queens),
            and Victoria Tennant (The Handmaid’s Tale [film]), join us for a
            panel on horror. Horror is a genre infamous for its often
            stereotypical and sadistic treatment of women on the screen.
            These actors have all been involved in horror/sci-fi films. They
            will talk about their time in the industry, their thoughts on the
            genre, how it treated them, and how it treats them. There will be a
            moderated portion, as well as a Q&A.</p>

            <h3>Student Official Selection</h3>
            <br>
            <p>IFF’s 2018 Official Selection of undergraduate and graduate student
            films features a curated program of 25 of the strongest films. This
            year’s Official Selection of screenplays will honor the top three
            scripts from four categories: undergraduate short, graduate short,
            features and TV pilots. The students on our programming and
            screenplay departments created these selections from over 500
            submissions, representing a total of 27 countries around the world.</p>


            <h3>Virtual Reality Arcade</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As one of the first student-run film festivals in the world to
            pioneer an initiative geared towards virtual reality, IFF’s New
            Media Initiative aims to foster the next generation’s dialogue
            around VR storytelling. This year, IFF will showcase student-made
            VR and AR projects on Google Daydream and HTC Vive, as well as
            provide a hands-on environment for attendees to explore cutting-edge
            new media technologies.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Screening of “Eighth Grade”</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Bo Burnham’s directorial debut premiered at the 2018 Sundance
            Film Festival to audience and critical acclaim, featuring breakout
            star Elsie Fisher. The story follows thirteen-year-old Kayla as she
            endures the tidal wave of contemporary suburban adolescence as she
            makes her way through the last week of middle school--the end of her
            thus far disastrous eighth grade year before she begins high school.
            Eighth Grade will be the final screening of IFF 2018.</p>


            <h3>Advanced Screening of “Blindspotting”</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Written and starring lifelong friends Daveed Diggs (Hamilton) and
            Rafael Casal, Blindspotting is about the intersection of race and
            class in increasingly-gentrified Oakland. It’ll make you laugh and
            shudder, and it’ll stay with you long after it’s over.</p>


            <h3>Advanced Screening of “RBG”<br>
            Followed by a Q&A with Director Betsy West</h3>
            <br>
            <p>RBG, an intimate portrait of the life and work of Justice Ruth Bader
             Ginsburg, premiered at Sundance earlier this year and is due in
             theaters on May 4th. With unprecedented access, the film explores
             how her early legal battles changed the world for women. This
             revelatory documentary screening will be followed by a dynamic
             Q&A with Director Betsy West.</p>


            <h3>Advanced Screening of “We The Animals”</h3>
            <br>
            <p>“This year’s “Moonlight.” That’s what IndieWire had to say about
            this deeply moving Sundance standout. Starring Raul Castillo and
            Josiah Gabriel, and directed by documentary veteran Jeremiah Zagar,
            this film follows three brothers through their troubled and
            formative childhood in upstate New York. Based on the novel by
            Justin Torres.</p>


            <h3>Aegean Film Festival Best of Europe Short Program</h3>
            <br>
            <p>IFF is proud to announce its first-ever partnership with the Aegean
            Film Festival, based in Patmos, Greece. IFF will feature the Aegean
            Film Festival’s Best of Europe Short Program, made up of
            award-winning short films from across Europe. A program of IFF’s
            official selection will be screened at the Aegean Film Festival
            this summer. This partnership aims to build lasting relationships
            between IFF and the international film community and provide new
            opportunities for students to engage with the globally-practiced
            craft of short filmmaking.</p>


            <h3>Production Workshop with Producer Tom Gormican</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Writer/Director of That Awkward Moment and Co-Creator of FOX’s
            Ghosted, Tom Gormican will join us for an intimate workshop and
            conversation. Spots will be limited.</p>


            <h1>More guests/events will be announced in the final schedule, to be posted soon!</h1>
