            <p>Ivy Film Festival has partnered with REACT to FILM to host thought-provoking documentary screenings paired with events to critically analyze, teach, and discuss social justice topics themselves as well as their depictions in film and media. Our screenings in partnership with REACT toFILM aim to serve as both a call to action for civic engagement on campus but also to demonstrate the power of film to provide a teaching moment and impact societal change. Past screenings have included: <em>After Spring, The Hunting Ground, The Mask You Live In, and 3 Â½ Minutes, Ten Bullets</em>.
